Website developed for a university project, in which we constructed a basic musical instrument that would receive the commands (notes) written in the computer prompt. 
For this purpose, we used a RaspberryPi, a Arduino Mega and a magnetic actuator. Therefore, the site would send to the RaspebrryPi's server the notes the player wanted to play
either individually or in a sequence and the mechanism would respond. After finishing the project, I modified the website, so it could be still be used without the instrument. However, it remains 
rather simple. I did it as a way to practice.
