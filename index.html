        Our main objective is to develop a mechanical system which utilises a
        simple lever principle in order to play the notes in the metalophone. Of
        course, this will be automated in a way that the user can choose a
        sequence of notes with a determined bpm in a easy and interactive
        interface.

        Briefly, we made a base of wood, in which we will allocate the motor,
        the 'Boule', as well as the Arduino MegaPi and the RaspeberryPi. In
        addition, the supports for the metal plates that will play the notes
        were made by a 3D printer.
